1. R00 = 80000000:
    * This is the memory address where the counter's value is being stored, as initialized in the program with `ldr r0, =0x80000000`.

2. R01 = bcf192f2:
    * This value represents the current state of the counter (`r1`). The program increments this value continously in the loop, and this value reflects the counter's progress at the time you checked the registers.

3. R02 = 80000100:
    * This could indicate a pointer or memory alignment operation, but isn't directly set by the provided code. If you modified the program, it might be related. 

4. R15 = 80010008:
    * Thi is the program counter (PC) and shows the instruction currently being executed. Since the program is looping indefinitely, it points to the instruction within the loop.
